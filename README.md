Web page for taking your notes

Wanted to make something interesting using JavaScript so i decided to make a web page for taking notes. All data i stored in local storage so everything disapears whet you clean you browser cache.

## Used technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to use
It's intuitively clear as for me. You can add new note using "Add new" option, edit text in the note window and save it.

## Fixes needed
1. [x] Sidebar's height changes as height of note window increases.
2. [x] While editing note and clicking to another, text from current note duplicates to this note.

## To add
1. [ ] Make page adaptive to mobile devices.
2. [x] Ability to delete existing note.
