# Note-web-page
Web page for taking your notes

Wanted to make something interesting using JavaScript so i decided to make an app for taking notes. But i can't make a backend for now, so it's not an all but just a web page. Unfortunately everything disapears as soon as you reload the page.

## Used technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## How to use
It's intuitively clear as for me. You can add new note using "Add new" option, edit text in the note window and save it.

## Fixes needed
1. Sidebar's height changes as height of note window increases.
2. While editing note and clicking to another, text from current note duplicates to this note.

## To add
1. Make app responsive to mobile devices.
2. Ability to delete existing note.
